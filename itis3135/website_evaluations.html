                <h3><a href="https://www.nike.com/">Nike</a></h3>
                <p>The Nike website offers a refined platform for being able to their shoes and apparel. It has a simple yet elegant design that is easy to navigate, they have simple and well organized information and sections that allow a seemless user experience. The homepage is well structured and organized and allows you to navigate to the products that you would be looking for very easily and efficiently. While also then giving you a great view of their products and what they are all about, allowing easy decision making.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Good contrast between the background and the text. The simple white background and black text are easily distinguishable. Largely though the contrast between the different sections is what helps with navigation the most to my eye.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The use of repetition allows for a smooth flow between the different sections of the website, allowing for easy navigation. Nike repeats the size and layout of things of similar nature, so products are organized and all sized the same on your screen, but even on the homepage, the navigation bar is using repetition to allow for easy navigation to any section. Also then theres repetition between the different sections of the website, when you scroll you see the different areas that Nike is pushing them most currently with repetitive sizes and layouts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Everything on the page was planned to be the way it is. Nike does a great job with alignment, allowing for a smooth flow between the different sections of the website. Each section is algined off each other allowing for the sections to be easily distinguishable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> The use of spacing allows the users to know what is suppposed to be related or not related. It also allows for a smooth flow between the different sections of the website.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale School of Art</a></h3>
                <p>The website has some of the wonkiest contrast I think I have ever seen, the website is very hard to navigate and is very unorganized. They have a nav bar stufed in a corner with no structure to it at all, they like half way algined things to be okay in some spots. There is a lot of very funny and pickable things for this website that arent the best practices.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The color contrast is very incosistent, the website is very hard to navigate and is very unorganized, there is different random background colors all over the page, the font color changes from black to white in spots where its in the same section. Also no contrast between the different sections of the website so very little navigatability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> I think the only thing that is repetitive in this website is the background image and the pure chaos of the website, genuinely the only repetitive thing besides the background image is that headers have white backgrounds and black text in most places.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> They didn't even align the background-image, they aligned the nav bar to the top left corner of the page and then kind of just slapped some stuff below it for always accessible information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> The content is all clumped on the left third of your screen, there is no spacing between the different sections of the website. Also sections are kind of just free flowing and not in any order.</li>
