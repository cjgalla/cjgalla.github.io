            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong>This photography website is designed to showcase the travel photography collection of my dad, who has journeyed across nearly all U.S. states and some international destinations. The goal of this site is to not only display the beauty of nature through high-quality images, but also to inspire others to explore the outdoors and discover new places to visit and experience the natural wonders of the world.</p>
            <p><strong>Intended Users:</strong> Intended for travel enthusiasts, nature lovers, and anyone who might have been to other places that they want to share with others.</p>
            <p><strong>Content Overview:</strong> The website will have a homepage featuring a few of the favorite pictures of my Dads, and an overview of the website and why he chose this concept. It will also have an about page which is going to go into about my dad and his travels, and talk about his love for nature and the world around us. Then there will be two gallery pages, the first is an all United States gallery featuring pictures from his and our cross country trips accross America. The second is an international gallery featuring pictures from the few places outside of the country, and why traveling can be so beneficial for you as a person. Then lastly there will be a review form for any comments or recommendations for future trips.</p>
