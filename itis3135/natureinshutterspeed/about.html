    <p>Being born in the US I always wanted to get the chance to get to explore this entire country I call home. So I made it a goal of mine to get and see all 50 states. Little did I know that would turn into 30 years of the travel bug and spreading the love for nature and the world around us to my son. Now I have been to 48 of the 50 states, and I have always enjoyed photography as a hobby. So when I started taking my son on cross country trips I bought a camera, and the rest, well you'll just have to see</p>
