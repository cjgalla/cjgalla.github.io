            <ul>
                <li><b>Personal Background:</b> I'm an only child who was born and raised in Raleigh North Carolina, after living in rural Youngsville for the first 4 years of my life. I went to public schools my whole life and have always had a drive to make other people's day better.</li>
                <li><b>Professional Background:</b> I do not have a lot of experience in the workforce as I have had quite an interesting past couple of years and certain circumstances made it hard for me to get a job. However I have lots of experience with doing charities and doing construction work with my father.</li>
                <li><b>Academic Background:</b> I graduated from my public high school in 2023 and am currently a sophomore majoring in Computer science with a cyber security concentration who is on track to graduate a little earlier than the fall of 2027.</li>
                <li><b>Background in this subject:</b>  I was a part of the coding club in elementary school and enjoyed learning cobra and applying it to robotic type applications, then once I was a senior in high school I took AP computer science. Once I started that class and learned java, I fell in love with coding and have run with it ever since. I'm Java certified and I have several years of coding experience. I also have some digital design certifications like photoshop and premiere pro.</li>
                <li><b>Primary Computer Platform:</b> Windows pc/laptop</li>
                <li><b>Courses:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>ITIS 3200 - Intro to Info Security and Privacy -</b> Major required course for me in cybersecurity but it's also the starting point for most of the concepts of cybersecurity as the security and privacy of information is one of the key concepts and points of cybersecurity.</li>
                        <li><b>ITIS 3135 - Web-based application design -</b> I've taken a few classes on stuff similar to this class but I also enjoy the graphic design side of things and have always enjoyed being able to have a physical embodiment of my code and work.</li>
                        <li><b>ITSC 3146 - Intro to Operating systems and networking -</b> Required class for my major but also I've been fascinated to learn about how a lot of the systems and networks I interact with on the daily run and are operated.</li>
                        <li><b>Math 1242 - Calculus 2 -</b> Required class for my major and I just simply feel like getting it out of the way so that I only have the 2 easier math classes remaining</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><b>Funny/Interesting item about yourself:</b> I've been to all 48 of the “continental” states, just waiting to go see Alaska and Hawaii.</li>
