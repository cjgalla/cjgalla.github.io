            <h2>What is Photography?</h2>
            <p>Photography is the art of capturing light with a camera to create stunning images. It is a form of visual storytelling that allows you to tell a story through the lens of a camera. It also allows you to be able to save memories to keep in theory forever. Pictures are an amazing gateway to creating and savoring memories that will last a lifetime, it also lets you use some of your creative side!</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a passionate photographer who loves capturing nature and landscapes. I have been on many cross country trips and have been to 48 out of the 50 states. I have also made trips out of the country and seen many parts of Japan and South Korea. I have a love of nature and landscapes, and the vast differences locations hold with wildlife and scenery.</p>

            <h2>Best Times for Photography</h2>
            <p>The golden hour, occurring during sunrise and sunset, provides the best natural lighting. It also provides such an amazing backdrop for capturing captivating images. Sunsets are my personal favorite as they are like the segway from a day to a peaceful night with such a serene view and display of nature. They also can create some of the prettiest effects on the clouds, and it can make for some really amazing views and shots.</p>

            <h2>Best Locations</h2>
            <p>National parks and urban cityscapes provide amazing photography opportunities. As well as the mountains and places with variety in the scale of things, it provides a way to use things in composition. Also it can lead you too having amazing experiences through the things you will see and experience in nature. Here are some cool shots from National Parks I have visited.</p>

        <section id="how">
            <h2>How to Start</h2>
            <p>Start with a simple camera, or even just your phone. Then, explore different settings and learn how to compose your shots to frame what youre trying to capture best. The first big keys into photography is composition and to be able to understand light and how to use it to your advantage. It's also all about what you personally see and what you think would make a cool shot, not everyone will agree, but someone will!</p>

        <section id="why">
            <h2>Why Photography?</h2>
            <p>Photography helps capture memories and explore creativity of the eye and mind. It helps us capture moments and memories so that they are not so easily forgotten. It's also a beautiful way to be able to share your trips and to be able to show people parts of the world they may not have seen. I personally love pictures for how they allow me to capture a moment in time and be able to take it all in again later down the line.</p>
